### Project Description
Badviser is a quirky web app that delivers random, hilariously awful life advice at the click of a button. 
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are overwhelmed with good advice, leading to responsible choices, stable lives, and boring dinner conversations. There’s no app to help you make entertainingly poor decisions — until now.
### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Badviser uses AI to generate absurd, illogical, and downright ridiculous suggestions for any situation. It’s your one-stop shop for life tips guaranteed to cause chaos, confusion, and comedy.
