### Project Description
Badviser is a witty web app that generates absurdly terrible advice for any situation. Whether you’re looking to ruin your diet, your relationships, or your career, Badviser has you covered.
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Too many people get good advice, leading to wise decisions, stable lives, and happiness — boring! Where’s the chaos, the drama, the poor life choices?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Badviser delivers the exact opposite of what you should do. With our AI-powered nonsense generator, you can finally make hilariously awful decisions with confidence.
